1) Create 4 Microservices - OrderService, StockService, EmailService & Base-Domains:- 
Objective: Architect a loosely coupled, event-driven system using microservices with a shared base module for domain models.

Microservice Design:

OrderService: Accepts orders and publishes events.

StockService: Listens to order events and updates inventory.

EmailService: Sends notifications after order processing.

Base-Domains: A shared module that contains common DTOs (Order, OrderEvent) used across services to maintain consistency.

Technical Setup:

Created four independent Spring Boot projects.

Imported all into IntelliJ IDEA for seamless multi-module development.

Used Maven with shared dependencies and separate application.properties per service.

Professional Insight:

Shared Base-Domains ensures reusability and consistency of model classes, promoting contract-first development.

2) OrderService Microservice - Configure Kafka Topic:- 
Objective: Enable OrderService to publish events to Kafka.

Kafka Configuration:

Added Kafka properties in application.properties (e.g., bootstrap servers, serializers).

Configured a topic name (order_topics) and producer properties.

Used NewTopic bean for topic creation at runtime.

Justification:

Automates Kafka topic provisioning.

Keeps infrastructure as code, enabling reproducibility across environments.

3) OrderService Microservice - Create Kafka Producer:- 
Objective: Implement a producer to send order events to Kafka.

Implementation:

Injected KafkaTemplate<String, OrderEvent> using Spring Kafka.

Developed a service method to build OrderEvent from Order and send to Kafka topic.

Included metadata like status (ORDER_CREATED) in the event.

Best Practice:

Decouples producer logic from the controller.

Enables easy extension for retries or dead-letter queues.

4) OrderService Microservice - Create REST API to Send Order and Tested Kafka Produce:- 
Objective: Expose a REST endpoint to place an order, produce Kafka event, and test end-to-end flow.

Technical Details:

Created REST controller with endpoint /api/orders.

Accepted Order as a request body and triggered event publishing via Kafka producer.

Validated using Postman and observed messages in Kafka topic.

Professional Perspective:

This provides an API façade for clients, hiding Kafka complexity.

Ensures synchronous API experience with asynchronous backend processing.

5) StockService Microservice - Configure Kafka Consumer:- 
Objective: Setup StockService to listen to order events for inventory updates.

Kafka Configuration:

Defined consumer properties: group ID, key/value deserializers.

Set topic subscription details and enabled JSON deserialization for OrderEvent.

Reasoning:

Consumer group setup enables scalability and fault tolerance.

Event-driven consumption promotes loose coupling.

6) StockService Microservice - Create Kafka Consumer:- 
Objective: Consume order events and simulate inventory processing.

Implementation:

Used @KafkaListener(topics = "...") to receive OrderEvent.

Parsed event, checked inventory logic (mocked), and logged response.

Could simulate failure or insufficient stock scenarios.

Interview Tip:

Emphasize idempotency, error handling, and retry logic in consumer processing.

7) EmailService Microservice - Configure and Create Kafka Consumer:- 
Objective: Send confirmation or failure emails upon receiving order events.

Kafka Listener Setup:

Similar configuration as StockService, subscribed to same order_topics.

Event Consumption:

Received OrderEvent, extracted customer info and order status.

Mocked sending of email (e.g., via log or service method).

Professional Value:

Demonstrates event fan-out pattern: one event triggers multiple independent downstream actions.

8) Run 3 Microservices Together and Have a Demo:- 
Objective: Validate end-to-end event flow across services.

Execution:

Started Kafka broker and all three services.

Placed order via OrderService REST endpoint.

Verified:

StockService consumes event and logs inventory update.

EmailService consumes event and logs email trigger.

Demo Outcome:

Proved successful implementation of an event-driven architecture.

Highlighted asynchronous processing, service decoupling, and modular deployment.

Summary :- 
This project demonstrates a real-world microservices system built using Spring Boot, Kafka, and domain-driven design. It showcases expertise in event streaming, system modularity, Kafka integration, and clean code separation—all critical for scalable enterprise systems.
